### a 3d printed housing for the eletronics will hold a rpi-02w to take the pictures then the power will be managed by a arduino nano that will also send a signal to take the picture and the rpi-02w will have rtc to keep the corect time and send the pictures to a thumb drive and this will be all in one contained unit that will be make to be somewhat water proof.

not nessicary but if you need incresed web functionality of the rpi-02w you can do a series of comands in the rerminal to help with the low ram but this can make hte sd card wear out faster so up to you  but jsut exciute the code is i have below and it should make it 2-3 times faster
