import all files from the folder to the pico espicaly the RTC_DS3231.py as its a library and i dont things will run without it.

**the best order to run files** to make sure everything is working and check that the parts are working firstly indivisualy and then tougher.

**dont add boot.py yet**
1. set-time-rtc.py
2. get-time-rtc.py
3. test-relay.py
